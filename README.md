### Responsive

The site is fully responsive, BUT... <br>
The primary feature of this game is touch typing, which is taught with hand placement on an external keyboard. <br>

The opening of the onscreen keyboard is a challenge for mobile and tablet use cases as only input text components allow the onscreen keyboard to be displayed<br>

When evaluating the mobile and tablet use cases, it became evident that the game was designed to teach touch typing techniques and improve keyboard skills.<br>

A javascript media query has been included for screen sizes of 1024px and smaller, displaying a warning and indicating that the game is not compatible with mobile and tablet use cases unless an external keyboard is used for typing.
